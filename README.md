# PM Operating System

A self-serve Cursor setup for product managers: rules, skills, and agents that adapt to your role, goals, and tools.

---

## Quick start (self-serve onboarding)

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sach1ng/PM-operating-OS.git
   cd PM-operating-OS
   ```

2. **Run onboarding** — Open the repo in Cursor, then in chat say: **"onboard"** or **"PM-OS setup"**. Answer the questions; the agent writes config and runs setup automatically.
   - *Or* manually edit `config/pm-os-config.yaml` and run `./scripts/setup.sh --copy`

3. **Restart Cursor** — Rules, skills, and agents will load from `~/.cursor/`.

## Structure (after onboarding)

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **.cursor/agents/** | Project-local onboarding agent (loaded when repo is open) |
| **config/** | Your answers → `pm-os-config.yaml` |
| **templates/** | Jinja2 templates for rules, agents, skills |
| **scripts/** | `setup.sh` / `setup.py` — generates personalized files |
| **output/** | Generated rules, agents, skills (gitignored) |
| **skills/** | Source for prd-writer, working-backwards, and expanded PM skills |
| **knowledge/** | Strategy docs (personas, metrics, competitive landscape) — used by agents and rules |
| **agents/** | Agent docs (see agents/README.md) |

---

## Rules, skills, and agents — what's the difference?

| | What it is | In plain terms |
|---|------------|----------------|
| **Rules** | Persistent guidance Cursor applies | How *you* work: standards, org context, prioritization |
| **Skills** | On-demand "how-to" Cursor uses when the task fits | PM capabilities: PRDs, working backwards, prioritization |
| **Agents** | Specialized assistants Cursor delegates to | Concrete tasks: VOC analysis, daily planning, strategy review |

---

## PM Workflows

| Workflow | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| **Planning** | strategy-connector, working-backwards |
| **Building** | prd-writer, one-pager, experiment-designer |
| **Shipping** | launch-readiness, launch-post |
| **Communicating** | exec-communicator, stakeholder-update |
| **Learning** | experiment-writeup, voc-analyzer |
| **Operating** | weekly-planner, meeting-to-actions, action-item-prioritizer |

---

## Knowledge Layer

The `knowledge/` directory holds strategy and domain context that agents and rules reference:

- **_template/** — Copy this folder and rename it for your domain (e.g., `my-product/`)
- **examples/** — Fully worked-out examples using public investor data from **Spotify, Netflix, Shopify, and Uber** (SEC 10-Ks, earnings calls, investor presentations)

**How to customize:** Edit the markdown files in `knowledge/` to reflect your product, team, and current strategy. Browse `knowledge/examples/` to see how real companies' strategy, segments, and metrics map to the template. The strategy-reviewer agent and domain context rule use this context automatically.

---

## Manual setup (without the script)

If you prefer not to run the setup script:

- Edit `config/pm-os-config.yaml` with your answers
- Copy `skills/` subfolders to `~/.cursor/skills/`
- Edit templates in `templates/` and copy outputs to `~/.cursor/` (rules, agents)

---

## Requirements

- **Cursor** with MCP support
- **Slack MCP** (for VOC analyzer, weekly planner, exec update generator)
- **Google Drive MCP** (for weekly planner, exec update generator)
- **Python 3** (for setup script; `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

---

## VOC Analyzer (Slack feedback)

If you enabled the VOC analyzer:

1. Configure **Slack MCP** in Cursor (Settings → MCP) with access to your VOC channel.
2. In Cursor chat, say: *"Analyze VOC"*, *"Slack VOC analysis"*, or *"Expert call feedback"*.
3. The agent searches your configured channel, classifies feedback by theme, and returns a PM report.

See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for details.
